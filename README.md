## Download

The easiest way to download the mod is through the [Steam Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1314446921).

If you don't have the steam version of HoI4 or want to use an older version of the mod, you can download it from our [Github Releases Page](https://github.com/HoI4-LOTRMod-Team/HoI4-LotrMod/releases). If you want to develop/contribute or access WIP content, you can simply clone this repository.

Note that downloading the mod from sources other than the Steam workwhop will require it to be manually installed. You can do so by placing it into `.../Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/lotr`, then copy-pase the `descriptor.mod` file from within into the folder outside, rename it to `lotr.mod` and add the line `path=".../Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/lotr"` to the bottom of it. (Change the three dots to your corresponding user directory and do *not* use back-slashes).
