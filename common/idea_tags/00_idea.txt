	# LOTR-related documentation regarding political advisors:
	# 
	# the small council is comprised of *characters*.
	# 1) The generic ones get generated in history/general/lotr_generic_advisors.txt
	# 2) The non-generic ones get generated in history/countrties/(...).txt and common/characters/(...).txt for each country 
	# 3) Each of these has a trait. The traits are defined in common/country_leader/00_traits_advisors_lotr.txt (or 00_traits.txt)
	# 4) Some of these traits have more interactions that are handled by decisions. These decisions are in common/decisions/advisor_decisions.txt
	# 5) Some of these decisions add dynamic modifiers which are located in 0_dynamic_modifiers_advisors.txt
	# 
	# Rather unintuitively, the research_council does *NOT* work in the same way. Namely 1) and 2) are different.
	# Reason: You can't add research-boosts to traits (thx Paradox)
	# Note: EXCEPT!!!! for the theorist. That guy is still a character because otherwise it fucks up the office corps x(
	# For this reason, ALL (generic and otherwise) research-council members are defines as *IDEAS* in common/ideas/zzz_lotr_advisors.txt
	# These ideas will *still* possess traits, which usually do absolutely nothing.
	# But having their corresponding traits assigned will let you check with 'has_idea_with_trait = pedantic_organizer' just like you would with the # characters.
	# 
	# TLDR: If you need to check for *has_x_guy_employed*, do this: 'has_idea_with_trait = pedantic_organizer'
	# If you need to modify/add a new advisor, you'll have to look at different files if its for the small_council, military_council or theorist than if not.
