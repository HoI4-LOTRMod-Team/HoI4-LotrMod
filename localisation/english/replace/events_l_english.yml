 political.18.d_gene:0 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] movement against the current regime has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many are now calling for [Root.GetLeader] to abdicate, a request so far disregarded by [Root.GetRulingParty] members.\n\nBut as the current [Root.GetAdjective] regime comes increasingly under mistrust and scrutiny, our opponents may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
