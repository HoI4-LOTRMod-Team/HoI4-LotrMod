ring_tuto.1.d:0 "The War of the Ring evolves around many things, but of course, a small golden trinket lies at the center of it all: The One Ring. \n\nIn this mod, the One Ring adopts the form of a National Spirit that grants a very significant stat boost to all your divisions.\nA few months into the game, Bilbo's 111st birthday celebrations will take place, and the 'Quest for the Ring' decisions will unlock. Countries that control states the fellowship passes through can try *once* to intercept the fellowship and seize the ring for themselves. The likelihood of these attempts being successful directly depends on the strength of the fellowship protecting Frodo.\n\nOnce the Ring reaches Rivendell, Elrond's Council will be invoked. The Nations of Gondor, Mirkwood and Erebor can then choose to add either their finest warrior, a decent replacement or no one at all to the Fellowship, as well as vote on which path the fellowship should take.\n\nIf no nation manages to obtain the ring before it reaches Mt. Doom, the Ring will be destroyed and the nation of Mordor will be severely weakened.\nIf a nation that has the ring capitulates, their attacker takes the ring from them.\n\nGood luck and have fun!"

ring_tuto.2.t:0 "Fellowship Combat"
ring_tuto.2.d:0 "When a hunting party attacks the fellowship, the following happens:\n\n- First, the hunting party must pass a 'stealth-check', to see if they are able to locate the fellowship. The success-rate of this check directly depends on the hunting parties *average* stealth (ie. planning) skill vs. that of the fellowship. Certain encounters, like the weathertop ambush, the orc-moria raid and Argonath raid do not require this step.\n\n- If the fellowship is successfully located, combat-proper begins. Each turn a random hunting-party member will attack a random fellowship-member, and a random fellowship-member will counter-attack a random hunting-party member. Attacks can be dodged based on the dexterity (ie. logistics) skill, and a successful attack will deal the attacker's attack-skill in damage to the health (defense skill) of the defender. If the health of a character reaches zero, they die.\n\n- This process is repeated until Frodo dies, the fellowship escapes or the hunting-party retreats. If Frodo dies, the hunting-party seizes the Ring for their nation.\n\n- When launching an intercepiton-attempt, you can select an 'acceptable casualty' rate. The lower this number is, the sooner your hunting-party will try to retreat."
