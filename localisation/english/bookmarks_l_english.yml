 WAR_OF_THE_RING_NAME:0 "War of the Ring"
 WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Thousands of years ago men, dwarves and elves fought side by side and through their endeavour, the forces of Mordor were vanquished. But we were fools to think ourselves victorious. For after lying hidden and dormant for centuries, the Dark Lord Sauron has once again risen from the darkness, adopting the shape of a lidless eye, looming over the dreaded Dark Tower of Barad-dûr. His unholy glare has set on the Kingdom of Gondor, a broken realm with no King and no purpose. Will the free men of Middle Earth unite in time to defeat the threat of Mordor?"
 MOR_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Vanquished in ages past, Dark Lord Sauron lay hidden for centuries, biding his time.\n\nNow, his eye has turned once more to his ancient stronghold, and from the blackened plains beneath Mount Doom, the forges roar to life. As an army, vast beyond count, rises at his command, the One Ring resurfaces in the hands of a Hobbit and threatens to make or break his reign of terror."
 GON_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "The line of kings is broken, and a steward now sits upon the throne, ruling over a people weary of war. Though Gondor's armies still hold fast to their ancient strongholds, shadows lengthen in the East, and the Dark Lord gathers his forces.\n\nWith the return of Sauron and the threat of the One Ring, Gondor must summon the courage of its past or face its darkest hour."
 ROH_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "For generations, the Rohirrim have ridden to war against the enemies of the West, their strength a vital shield for the Free Peoples of Middle-earth.\n\nBut dark whispers now creep into the halls of Meduseld, and shadow clouds the mind of King Théoden. Though his people would rally behind him without question, what if the King himself falters?"
 ISE_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Once a stronghold of Gondor, Isengard has long served as the home and realm of Saruman the White. Rohan and Gondor once welcomed such a mighty ally in their midst, trusting in his wisdom and strength to help guard the West.\n\nBut Isengard has changed. Dark smoke now rises from its forges, and Saruman's gaze turns not to aid, but to conquest."
 RIV_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Hidden in the deep, serene valleys of the Misty Mountains, Rivendell has long stood as a beacon of peace in a troubled world. Under the wise and watchful eye of Lord Elrond, it has offered refuge to those in need and counsel to the mighty.\n\nBut the shadows lengthen, and even Rivendell's fate hangs in the balance. If unity is not found among men and elves, the storm may taint even these great halls."
 ERE_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, bears the scars of a recent history drenched in bloodshed. The demise of Smaug, once a glorious triumph for the Dwarves, has not marked the end of their troubles. Dark clouds gather on the horizon, for a horde of Easterlings stirs, threatening to cross the Redwater.\n\nThe Dwarves have endured much, and they will not so easily give up their home again."
 LTH_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Isolated in the heart of Middle-earth, Lothlórien is the realm of Celeborn and Galadriel, whose ethereal presence has become the very identity of their land. The Elves revere and celebrate their leaders, yet to outsiders, these enigmatic people inspire only mistrust and suspicion.\n\nAs the fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance, the loyalties of Lothlórien may prove pivotal."
 HAR_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Haradwaith, a vast realm of sun-baked deserts and sprawling cities, is a land of many faces, yet splintered and divided. Its myriad peoples, each with their own ambitions, vie for power in a treacherous political landscape.\n\nAmong them are those who openly seek an alliance with the Dark Lord of Mordor, drawn by promises of strength and dominion. But there are also those, who would resist him."
 RHU_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Rhûn, a land of sprawling plains and fierce warriors, stands poised as a formidable power in the East. Rhûn is wealthy and militarily capable, with a fierce determination to assert its influence across Middle-Earth.\n\nYet, within its borders, the whispers of the Blue Wizards echo, urging the people toward a more benevolent fate."
 ANG_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Once a realm of fear and darkness, Angmar was defeated by the valor of the men of Arnor and Gondor, and the new rulers now promise peace to their war-torn land. Yet, as the shadow stirs once more in Mordor, old ambitions awaken from their slumber.\n\nWhispers of past glory echo through the halls of Carn Dûm, calling forth those who yearn for power and revenge."
 ART_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Arthedain, the strongest of the remnants of Arnor, stands as a testament to resilience amid desolation. Under the watchful guardianship of the Rangers, this realm has preserved a fragile peace, holding back the tides of darkness that threaten to engulf the land.\n\nWhile peace reigns for now, the specter of war hangs heavy in the air, as darkness looms both north and east."
 SHI_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "The Shire, a tranquil land of rolling hills and lush meadows, is home to the hobbits—pacifists and isolationists who cherish peace and the simple pleasures of life. With no desire to meddle in the affairs of the wider world, they live contentedly, far removed from the chaos of war.\n\nYet, as the One Ring resurfaces amidst their peaceful existence, so too does the shadow of war."
 MOA_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "After the triumphant reclamation of Erebor, Balin leads a brave expedition to recover the ancient mines of Moria, seeking to restore the glory of the Dwarves. Yet, the once-great halls have transformed into a waking nightmare.\n\nOrcs pour forth from the darkness in endless numbers and deep underground, ancient flames begin to stir. A quest for glory, turned into a struggle for survival. "
 LIN_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "The Havens of Lindon stand as a shimmering refuge on the western shores of Middle-earth, a sanctuary where Elves and travelers find solace amidst gathering storms. Under the watchful guidance of Círdan the Shipwright, these ancient havens serve as a gateway to the Undying Lands.\n\nYet, as the shadows of Mordor stretch ever closer, even this tranquil place cannot remain untouched."
 ELU_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "The Ered Luin, or the Blue Mountains, cradle the proud Dwarves who call this rugged terrain home. Once thriving with the wealth of their craftsmanship and the echoes of hammers striking stone, this realm now feels the weight of isolation and uncertainty.\n\nAs the shadows of the East grow bolder, their once-firm alliances with the Free Peoples may be tested."
 OTHER_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Middle-Earth is home to a wide variety of people, each with their own distinct strengths and weaknesses. As the tides of war rise, fate may be altered by the most unexpected of peoples."
