rohanlords.11.t:0 "Marshals of Rohan"
rohanlords.11.d:0 "Rohan is divided into five semi-autonomous regions, each governed by a Marshal. You can appoint new Marshals through specific focuses in your focus tree. Choosing the right Marshal is crucial since their effectiveness directly impacts the prosperity of their respective region.\n\nEach Marshal comes with four policy-related demands, which you can view by hovering over their portrait. Meeting these demands increases the Marshal's approval rating. Higher approval ratings mean an increased number of factories, more resources, and higher manpower, all of which you can enhance through targeted investments via decisions and focuses.\n\nRealm cohesion is another critical aspect of governing Rohan. It grants country-wide bonuses to political power, stability, war support, and surrender limit. The weekly drift of realm cohesion, which is equal to the average approval rating of your Marshals, determines how these bonuses evolve over time."
