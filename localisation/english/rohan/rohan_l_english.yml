rohanlords.6.d:0 "In a move orchestrated by Grima Wormtongue, Herethain, a Dunlending, has been appointed as the new governor of the Westmarch. Wormtongue cites hopes of improving ties with our western neighbors, though there is speculation that this decision is meant to curry favor with Isengard.\n\nHerethain has sworn to serve dutifully and has a proven track record as a valiant warrior, yet there is no doubt that he will never be a true Rohirrim.

Widgelred, on the other hand, is a staunch supporter of Wormtongue, indicating that this appointment serves Wormtongue's interests above all.\n\nThe populace remains skeptical, aware that Widgelred's loyalty lies more with Wormtongue than with the welfare of Eastemnet. Many fear this change will bring further instability and division."
