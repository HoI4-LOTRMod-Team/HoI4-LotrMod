rohan.11.t:0 "Théodred dies"
rohan.11.d:0 "Dark tidings have reached us from the Fords of Isen: Théodred, heir to King Théoden, is dead. The circumstances surrounding his death are shrouded in mystery, with rumors of treachery and foul play. His loss is a grievous blow to the realm, leaving Rohan without its brave prince and future king.\n\nTheoden's heart is heavy with sorrow, and the people of Rohan mourn deeply. We must remain vigilant in these troubled times."
rohan.11.a:0 "Oh no! Anyway..."

rohan.12.t:0 "Éomer Found Dead"
rohan.12.d:0 "Éomer, Marshal of the Riddermark and nephew to King Théoden, has been found dead in his quarters, a dagger buried in his chest. The whispers in the halls speak of betrayal, and the manner of his death points to a sinister plot.\n\nThe path ahead grows ever more perilous as the enemies of Rohan close in from all sides."
rohan.12.a:0 "Such tragedy! The King will need guidance in these troubled times..."

rohan.80.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] disapproves of Grima Wormtongue's appointment"
rohan.80.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has sent word expressing grave concern over King Théoden's recent decision to appoint Gríma Wormtongue as his chief advisor. They question Wormtongue's motives and loyalty, fearing that his influence may bring harm to the kingdom of Rohan.\n\nThey urge King Théoden to reconsider this appointment and to seek counsel from those with proven loyalty and wisdom. The eyes of our allies are upon us, and the well-being of our realm depends on the soundness of our leadership."
rohan.80.a:0 "Their words have been heard."

rohan.81.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] working against Gríma Wormtongue"
rohan.81.d:0 "Rumors have reached us that agents, dissidents, and spies from [FROM.GetName] are working covertly to undermine Gríma Wormtongue's hold on power. These shadowy figures are said to be sowing discord and gathering support to challenge Wormtongue's influence over King Théoden.\n\nWhether these rumors hold truth or are merely the result of growing paranoia, they add to the tension and unrest already brewing within our realm."
rohan.81.a:0 "Scoundrels!"

rohan.82.t:0 "Foreign Plot Exposed"
rohan.82.d:0 "A clandestine plot by [FROM.GetName] has been uncovered and swiftly quashed. These foreign agents were attempting to influence our politics and work against Gríma Wormtongue, seeking to weaken his grip on power.\n\nThe exposure of such blatant interference by [FROM.GetName] has led to an increase in Wormtongue's support as the people rally against foreign meddling."
rohan.82.a:0 "[FROM.GetName] should learn not to meddle in our affairs!"

rohan.83.t:0 "Saruman offers Support to Wormtongue"
rohan.83.d:0 "Saruman of Isengard has extended his support to Gríma Wormtongue. While many see the White Wizard in a hostile light, his influence in the region cannot be ignored. There is a growing belief that the only hope to prevent war between Rohan and Isengard is to appease Saruman by empowering the king's chief counselor."
rohan.83.a:0 "Uncertain times..."

rohan.84.t:0 "Political blowback from our war with Rohan"
rohan.84.d:0 "Rohan, in an attempt to ease tensions, had recently appointed a politician named Frumbold to their royal council. This gesture of goodwill was intended to foster peace and cooperation between our realms. However, with our declaration of war on Rohan, this act of diplomacy now casts our actions in a stark and unfavorable light, leading to significant political blowback."
rohan.84.a:0 "This won't save them..."

rohan.85.t:0 "Minor Setbacks due to Rohan's Concessions"
rohan.85.d:0 "Despite Rohan's desperate concessions to avoid war, we have rightfully asserted our dominance by declaring conflict. While this has caused some grumbling among our troops and workers, who had grown complacent relying on these concessions, it is but a minor inconvenience.\n\nThe temporary dip in morale is hardly a concern. With a bit of stern leadership and motivation, our forces will quickly fall back in line, ready to execute our grand plans. This war will proceed as intended, and Rohan's futile attempts at diplomacy will be their undoing."
rohan.85.a:0 "Just a minor hiccup."

rohan.86.t:0 "Eorlist Coup successful!"
rohan.86.d:0 "The King's council has executed an unprecedented court-internal coup. In a secretive and unannounced meeting, the loyalists of the House of Eorl have successfully convinced King Théoden to sign a decree abolishing the post of Chief Advisor entirely.\n\nWith Gríma Wormtongue removed from the equation, King Théoden has regained his clarity and control over the kingdom."
rohan.86.a:0 "Long live the King!"

rohan.88.t:0 "The Fate of Gríma Wormtongue"
rohan.88.d:0 "With King Théoden now fully restored to his senses, we are faced with a pressing decision regarding the disgraced Gríma Wormtongue. Political pressure is mounting, and the time has come to determine his fate.\n\nShould we choose to exile Wormtongue, he will be removed from the realm but free to wander elsewhere, potentially plotting from the shadows. Alternatively, executing him would eliminate any threat of his return but may provoke backlash from those who still see value in his life."
rohan.88.a:0 "Death to traitors!"
rohan.88.b:0 "Let him go and rot in Saruman's shadow..."

rohan.89.t:0 "Rohan asks for Truce"
rohan.89.d:0 "News has reached us that Gríma Wormtongue has seized power in Rohan, bringing the entire royal court under his control. While he is a slippery and cunning individual, he has previously proclaimed his loyalty to us.\n\nRohan has asked for a temporary truce, and to give them time for a formal submission to our overlordship."
rohan.89.a:0 "We will give them a few days to proclaim their loyalty."
rohan.89.a_tt:0 "We will be able to force them to choose a side as the truce nears its end."
rohan.89.b:0 "Too bad! Keep up the pressure!"

rohan.90.t:0 "Rohan stands defiant"
rohan.90.d:0 "Despite Gríma Wormtongue's control over Rohan, he and the rest of the Rohirrim refuse to bow down and proclaim their loyalty to us. They claim to desire peace and an end to hostilities, but they steadfastly reject any notion of submission or vassalization of their realm.\n\nThis defiance complicates our plans, as Wormtongue's reluctance to fully align with Isengard undermines the benefits of his rule."
rohan.90.a:0 "We have bigger fish to fry..."
rohan.90.b:0 "That slippery worm will pay for his insolence!"
rohan.90.c:0 "Then more blood will flow."

rohan.91.t:0 "Rohan offers concessions"
rohan.91.d:0 "Rohan's newly appointed Marshal of the Westemnet has reached out with significant concessions in an attempt to placate us. They have agreed to pay substantial tribute and offer us favorable prices for their resources.\n\nWhile this is a feeble attempt at peace, accepting these terms could be beneficial in the short term. However, should we choose to declare war despite these concessions, the political blowback will be inevitable."

rohan.94.a:0 "Demand their answer."

rohan.95.t:0 "Isengard's Ultimatum"
rohan.95.d:0 "Isengard has issued a demand that we choose a side. The time has come for us to decide: do we submit to Saruman's will, or do we strive to go our own way and preserve our independence?"
rohan.95.a:0 "We pledge ourselves to Saruman."
rohan.95.b:0 "We will not kneel to Saruman!"

rohan.96.t:0 "Rohan Submits"
rohan.96.d:0 "Rohan has decided to submit to our authority and become a vassal state of Isengard. This move signifies a major shift in their stance, aligning them under our control and securing their loyalty.\n\nAre they worthy of our leadership?"
rohan.96.a:0 "At last, they come around."
rohan.96.b:0 "They are not worthy of our reign."

rohan.97.t:0 "Saruman Rejects Our Submission"
rohan.97.d:0 "Despite our offer to submit and become a vassal state of Isengard, Saruman has refused to acknowledge our submission. The White Wizard deems us unworthy of his leadership and has declared that he would rather see the fields of Rohan burned than accept us as his vassals."
rohan.97.a:0 "Oof."

rohan.98.t:0 "Submission Accepted by Saruman"
rohan.98.d:0 "Saruman has accepted our offer of submission, and Rohan is now a vassal state of Isengard. The borders between our realms have been frozen, and hostilities have ceased. This marks the beginning of a new era of alignment under Saruman's rule.\n\nWhile we have secured a temporary peace, our autonomy is now limited. If we desire more independence or wish to renegotiate our terms, we will need to engage in further discussions with Saruman."
