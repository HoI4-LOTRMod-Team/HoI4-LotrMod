He argues that defeating Sauron alone will not rid the world of darkness, for another Dark Lord could rise in his place. In his view, fundamental changes in the old ways and hierarchies of society are the key to ensuring the forces of dark are expunged for good.\n\nAs these differences come to light, our realm finds itself at a crossroads. Every moment we delay is a gift to the forces of Mordor. If the two sides cannot come to an agreement in due time, our realm will be torn asunder at the seams."
