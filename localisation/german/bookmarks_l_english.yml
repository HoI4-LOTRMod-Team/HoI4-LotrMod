 WAR_OF_THE_RING_NAME:0 "War of the Ring"
 WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Thousands of years ago men, dwarves and elves fought side by side and through their endeavour, the forces of Mordor were vanquished. But we were fools to think ourselves victorious. For after lying hidden and dormant for centuries, the Dark Lord Sauron has once again risen from the darkness, adopting the shape of a lidless eye, looming over the dreaded Dark Tower of Barad-dûr. His unholy glare has set on the Kingdom of Gondor, a broken realm with no King and no purpose. Will the free men of Middle Earth unite in time to defeat the threat of Mordor?"
 MOR_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "After lying hidden and dormant for centuries, the Dark Lord Sauron has returned to claim dominion over all Middle Earth. This time he would coerce his unholy reign unto all living beings, but one small hindrance stands in his way: Sauron imbued the One Ring with a significant portion of his might. It must be recovered at all cost, for if it were to be destroyed, the legacy of Morgoth would be wiped out forever."
 GON_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "The kingdom of Gondor can hardly be called a kingdom anymore, for after Isildur's death all heirs have refused to sit upon the throne. Now the darkness of Mordor threatens to plunge all of Middle Earth into eternal nightfall and it will be Gondor where they strike first. Seek out Isildur's true heir, crown a new king or abandon monarchy all together, but something has to be done, or death will be upon the realm of Gondor."
 ROH_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Rohan has enjoyed a  close allegiance to Gondor for a long time. However, now Gondor is being kept busy with the rising threat of Mordor and simultaneously Saruman threatens to overrun our great bastion of Helm's Deep. The people of Rohan are loyal and would never doubt to unite behind their king, Theoden, but what if the king himself corrupts?"
 ISE_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "The stronghold of Isengard has served as the personal realm and home of Saruman the White for many years. The Kingdom of Rohan once welcomed such a powerful ally in the region. However, the relationship between Rohan and Isengard has suffered as of late, as rumors claim that Saruman has seen the eye of Sauron through a Palanthir."
 RIV_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "The peaceful and sheltered town of Rivendell has always been known as a haven of safety and security. But with Mordor threatening to destroy the realms of men, action must be taken. Lord Elrond is a powerful and influential figure, leaving many options available. Unite with Gondor against the threat of Sauron, or unite the northern Nations in a powerful alliance to stand against the darkness."
 ERE_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "The recent history of Erebor is quenched in bloodshed. However, the demise of Smaug is not to be the last of Lonely Mountain's many troubles. A horde of Easterling soldiers threaten to unite with Mordor and swarm over the Redwater, opening up a second front. Meanwhile the Mines of Moria are being overrun and the Elves of the Mirkwood will seek for any excuse to wipe the dwarves out."
 LTH_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC:0 "Mostly considered to be neutral and pacifist, the people of Lothlòrien are a true wildcard in the War of the Ring. The House of Celeborn and Galadriel have become the identity of the nation and their people will unite behind any cause their rulers see fit, be that neutral pacifism or licentious conquest."
