[i]"One by one the free lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor and on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth. Victory was near but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment when all hope had faded that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father's sword... Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples of Middle-earth was defeated."[/i]

[h1]Things you might want to know before getting started[/h1]

- Games are usually shorter than vanilla HoI4, since there is only one continent.
- Default political events such as ideology referendums will NOT occur for any nation with a custom focus tree except Angmar, Entwood or Harad.
- Prioritizing any national focuses underneath the 'The Fate of [countryname]' focus is usually a good idea.
- Playing as Northern Wastes is [u]not[/u] recommended.
- Due to the sheer amount of files we change, this mod is not compatible with most other mods.

[h1]Concerning the Ring mechanic[/h1]

- The ring takes the form of a National Spirit that grants a significant stat boost to all your divisions. Whichever nation gets the ring, will have the stat boost.
- Watch out for a news-event with the title 'Paranormal Activities in the Shire'. It will unlock crucial decisions regarding the One Ring.
- Once the ring reaches Rivendell, a fellowship will be put together. Erebor, Gondor and Mirkwood will have the option to add one of their commanders to it.
- The strength of the fellowship will determine how likely any nation can take the Ring.
- The nations of Moria, Lothlorien, Isengard and Gondor have their own specific events to interact with the fellowship.
- All other nations get a single chance of either helping or attacking the fellowship. They can only do so if the fellowship passes through their territory.
- Capture the Ring: If the nation who has the ring capitulates or get annexed, the winner receives the ring.
