[i]"One by one the free lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor and on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth. Victory was near but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment when all hope had faded that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father's sword... Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples of Middle-earth was defeated."[/i]

[h1]Things you might want to know before getting started[/h1]

- Games are usually shorter than vanilla HoI4, since there is only one continent.
- Default political events such as ideology referendums will NOT occur for any nation with a custom focus tree except Angmar, Entwood or Harad.
- Prioritizing any national focuses underneath the 'The Fate of [countryname]' focus is usually a good idea.
- Around December 1936 Elrond's Council will be invoked, at this point the nations of Mirkwood, Gondor and Erebor may decide who will constitute the fellowship of the ring.
- The skills of the fellowship will determine how likely any nation can take the Ring. (see below)
- The nations of Lothlorien, Isengard, Gondor and Mordor can attempt to obtain the ring through their focus tree at specific timeframes.
- Capture the Ring: If the nation who has the ring capitulates or get annexed, the winner receives the ring.
- The river between Dagorlad and Rohan is impassable.
- Playing as Northern Wastes is [u]not[/u] recommended.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

- English is the only supported language. If you set your game language to anything different, the mod will not display properly.
- The mod is not ironman friendly.
- Not complatible with r56, Millenium Dawn or any other gameplay-changing mod. I recommend playing on vanilla HoI4.
- No dlc required, all dlc compatible
- Multiplayer compatible

[h1]Concerning the Ring mechanic[/h1]

- The ring takes the form of a National Spirit that grants a significant stat boost to all your divisions. Whichever nation gets the ring, will have the stat boost.
- Capture the Ring: If the nation who has the ring capitulates or get annexed, the winner receives the ring.
- At around December 1936 Rivendell will invoke the Council of Elrond and following nations can decide to do following:
- Mirkwood can decide whether to add Legolas, Tauriel or nobody to the fellowship.
- Erebor can decide whether to add Gimli, Bombur or nobody to the fellowship.
- Gondor can decide whether to add Boromir, Faramir or nobody to the fellowship.
- Legolas, Gimli and Boromir are tier 1 fellowship members.
- Tauriel, Bombur and Faramir are tier 2 fellowship memebers.
- After the council, a news event titled 'The Fellowship of the Ring' will display for all nations showing a picture of the fellowship. Take a look at it to know which nations decided to do what.

[u]Example:[/u]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/c9ANVOO.png[/img]
[i]As you can see, in this particular example, Gondor sent Boromir, Erebor sent Bombur and Mirkwood sent nobody, meaning that the fellowship is somewhat weak and the ring might be intercepted. (The strongest fellowship includes of Legolas, Boromir and Gimli. Aragorn, Gandalf and the Hobbits will always be part of it.)[/i]

- If Gondor assasinates Aragorn through their focus tree, the fellowship will be weakend
- Lothlorien can attempt to take the Ring from Frodo. The likeliness of success will be drastically reducen for every tier 1 fellowship member and moderately reduced for every tier 2 fellowship member.
- At the same time, Lothlorien can also choose to gear up the fellowship, decreasing the likeliness of success for any following attempts at ring interception.
- Fascist Isengard can hunt for the rin. just like with Lothlorien, tier 1 fellowship members will drastically reduce the successrate while tier 2 members only moderately.
- If Gondor sent Boromir with the fellowship and he hasn't died, Gondor can try to have Boromir steal the ring from Frodo. Only the fellowship-members from Mirkwood and Erebor will have an effect on the success-rate.
- Mordor can also try to intercept the ring . As the fellowship has broken appart by this point, fellowship members will not affect the successrate, but whether if Lothlorien geared up the fellowship still will.
- If the ring does not get found at any of these attempts, it will be destroyed at around 1943, severely crippling the nation of Mordor, as Sauron will die.
- Mordor can also attempt to search the shire for the ring before the fellowship is formed. The successrate for this attempt is static at 5%.
- If the ring gets found at any point, no further attempt can be made to obtain it, but defeating the nation that has it allows you to capture it.

Disclaimer: This is an older mod that hasn't always been actively developed. I created it back when "National Unity" was still a thing and "Decisions" were not. Correspondingly, even though it runs on the most current version, it doesn't utilize many modern hoi4 features (such as decisions, espionage etc.)
