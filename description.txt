[i]"One by one the free lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor and on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth. Victory was near but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment when all hope had faded that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father's sword... Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples of Middle-earth was defeated."[/i]

[h1]FAQ[/h1]

[i]What are the strange white squares on my screen?[/i]
They are a graphical glitch that we haven't figured out how to fix yet. To get rid of them, you can switch your Renderer to DirectX9 in the launcher settings.

[i]How do I win the Moria Civil War?[/i]
There are many things you can do, and it is consistently winnable. The most important things are to use Oin as your general, to stack production efficiency techs, entrench yourself from day 1 and *not* to use Last Stand.

[i]How do I get the Ring as [insert country name]?[/i]
Getting the ring is not something that can be done consistently, and depends largely on luck. There are however some things you can do to increase your chances. Make sure to assemble your hunting party sensibly. Selecting *all* available generals isn't always the most sensible thing to do. Some countries also have additional focuses and decisions to help them on their interceptions.

[i]What are some good templates?[/i]
We try to keep things balanced and hope to avoid a situation in which there is one template to rule them all. But in general, commonly used frontline infantry units tend to be comprised of infantry and archers in a 7-2 or 9-1 ratio. Try experimenting around with some of our new unit types. That's part of the fun!

[i]Can I play this Multiplayer?[/i]
Yes, the mod is multiplayer compatible. We generally try to keep things more-or-less balanced, but due to our small team, that isn't always the case.

[i]Is this mod compatible with insert other mod?[/i]
Some mods, like music mods and a few others are compatible. But our mod changes *a lot* of files, and is unlikely to be compatible with the vast majority of other mods.
