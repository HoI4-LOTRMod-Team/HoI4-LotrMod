# This is a script that automatically converts leader portaits into
# "small", advisor portraits.
# 
# Usage:
# python convert_to_small.py some_folder
# will convert all portraits in the gfx/leaders/some_folder folder
# and put them inside a gfx/leaders/some_folder/small
# 
# The output of the script will correspond to a .gfx file that includes all the definitions.
# You can use a redirection/pipe operator to write this directly into the correct file. Example:
# 
# python.exe .\convert_to_small.py 0_generic_Men | Out-File ../../../interface/leaders/lotr_leaders_men.gfx -Encoding ASCII
